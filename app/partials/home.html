<h2>EcmaScript 6 in Action</h2>
<p>
	I created this page to show new feature of EcmaScript6 in action. Since still (now it's May of 2015) EcmaScript6 is not supported in all browsers I had to use Babel in some cases (even Babel doesn't support everything).
</p>
<p>
	Go to <a ng-href="#/ecma6">EcmaScript6 Examples</a> to see examples. On the left side there will be links to each new feature in EcmaScript6 and sub-link which will be native (source code not converted with Babel) and Babel (source code converted with babel). On the right side of each page you will see logger dump of the code running.
	Source code you will see in the middle will be code how it should be written for EcmaScript6, but based on link (babel or not), it will run different code. In pages where babel code is being run you will be able to click "Show Babel" to see in what code it converted initial EcmaScript6 code.
	Some pages will have only native in case Babel conversion is the same.
