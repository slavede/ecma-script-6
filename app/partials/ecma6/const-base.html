There is no babel example because browsers support it. Even it they don't, when it comes to compilation of ES6 to ES5 in Babel, it checks for syntax/logic errors in file, and I couldn't show throwing of exceptions there in case of, for example, redefining constant.
<pre>
'use strict';
var myInnerConstant;

const myConstant = 123;

if (myConstant === 123) {
	const myInnerConstant = 444;
	<span class="message-class-const1">AppLogger.info('In the block: ' + myInnerConstant);</span>
}

<span class="message-class-const2">AppLogger.info('Outside the block: ' + myInnerConstant);</span>

try {
	myConstant = 666;
} catch (e) {
	<span class="message-class-const3">AppLogger.info('Thrown exception because of trying to redefine it');</span>
	console.log(e);
}
</pre>
